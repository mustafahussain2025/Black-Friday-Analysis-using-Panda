# Black Friday Sales Analysis

# Problem Statement
The goal of this analysis is to gain insights into consumer behavior, purchasing patterns, and the influence of demographics on Black Friday sales. By examining a dataset with various customer and transaction attributes, we aim to answer the following questions:

How do different demographic factors (age, gender, marital status) influence purchasing behavior?
What are the most popular products and categories, and how do preferences vary among different customer segments?
What are the spending habits, including average spend per transaction, high-value purchases, and overall sales trends?
How does purchasing behavior vary across different city categories and residential stability?
How does occupation influence purchasing decisions and spending levels?
How can we identify loyal customers based on repeat purchases?

# Approach
To address these questions, we utilize the following columns in our dataset:

user_id
product_id
gender
age
occupation
city_category
stay_in_current_city_years
marital_status
product_category_1
product_category_2
product_category_3
purchase
Data Cleaning and Preparation

Handling Missing Values: Identify and handle any missing values in the dataset, especially in product categories.
Categorical Encoding: Encode categorical variables (e.g., gender, age, city_category) for analysis.
Normalization: Normalize purchase amounts if needed to reduce the impact of outliers.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Demographic Analysis: Analyze the distribution of gender, age, marital status, and occupation in the dataset. Examine their relationship with purchase behavior.
Product Analysis: Identify the most frequently purchased products and categories. Analyze purchase amounts across different product categories.
Spending Patterns: Calculate average spend per transaction, identify high-value purchases, and analyze overall sales trends.
City-wise Analysis: Examine how purchasing behavior varies across different city categories and residential stability (stay_in_current_city_years).
Occupational Influence: Analyze how occupation affects purchasing decisions and spending levels.
Repeat Purchases: Identify patterns of repeat purchases to pinpoint loyal customers.
Visualization

Demographic Trends: Use bar charts and histograms to visualize the distribution of demographic attributes and their purchasing behavior.
Product Popularity: Create bar charts and pie charts to display the popularity of products and categories.
Spending Analysis: Use box plots and scatter plots to show spending patterns and high-value purchases.
City and Occupation Analysis: Use heatmaps and bar charts to visualize the impact of city category and occupation on purchasing behavior.
Statistical Analysis

Correlation Analysis: Calculate the correlation between different variables to identify significant relationships.
Hypothesis Testing: Conduct hypothesis tests to determine if differences in purchasing behavior across demographics are statistically significant.
